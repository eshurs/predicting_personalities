# Predicting Personalities with Natural Language Processing

The goal of this project is to model an individual's personality traits using NLP algorithms on their written responses.
This project uses survey questions from the following source.

### Personality Traits Framework: Five-Factor *OCEAN* Model of Personality

The basis of personality traits used for this project are derived from the Five-Factor Model (Goldberg, 1990; McCrae & John, 1992; McCrae & Costa, 1987).
[Linked Paper](https://openpress.usask.ca/introductiontopsychology/chapter/personality-traits/#:~:text=The%20most%20widely%20used%20system,Extraversion%2C%20Agreeableness%2C%20and%20Neuroticism)

The five personality traits in question are described below:

*This project uses "Emotional Stability" as opposed to "Neuroticism" so that all traits can be visualized with the same a positive/negative attribute convention: 
- Openness / Close-mindedness
- Conscientious / Unconscientious
- Extroverte / Introverted
- Agreeable / Disagreeable
- Emotionally Stable / Neurotic

### Project Application

One of the proposed applications of this project is to breakdown the personality traits of users on a dating app so that they could be matched with other users with more compatability (see [OK Cupid Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles)). \nBelow is a possible user-facing visualization that would allow for a more transparent assessment of a proposed match so that all users can be more informed.
